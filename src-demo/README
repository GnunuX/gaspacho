Gaspacho demo is a tested version of the gaspacho backend.

This version will be remove when the true backend will be ended.

Dependancies: python, python-elixir.

There is two directories:
- bdd: every classes to access to the database ;
- api: you should not access to the bdd directly, use api to do this.

Two scripts help you to test this demo:
- import_test.py: create a bdd, use this script only one time (or remove gaspacho.sqlite before) ;
- api_test.py: is a test file to access to the api, you can modify it and use it more than one time.

Enjoy.
